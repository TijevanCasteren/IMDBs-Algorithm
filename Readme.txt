This project contains a machine learning project that analyses around 1000 scripts that are publicly available on IMDBs.com. 
The scripts were scanned on particular features, in order to predict the movie rating that corresponds with every script. 
The features are described in detail in the report that's in the folder.
Some features include the lexical diversity and the type of word, for example nouns or adverbs. In the end, so correlations were observed, with moderate values.



CONCLUSIONS
The carried-out analysis showed that textual content of a movie (script analysis) cannot completely account for success among the audience as we hoped for.
Nevertheless, some correlations were observed, despite its moderate values. 
Besides features like actors' and director' talents, production budget, etc., possible reasons such as dialogs and scenery descriptions were not separated during script analysis; relatively low response variance (scripts are available only for the most significant movies which have ratings 5-9 out of 10). 
Nevertheless, movies have a unique advantage of popularity criteria, the ratings from imdb.com, being easily extractable. 
This sharply contrasts with other purely textual artworks, such as novels, where much more correlation between success and the text analysis could be expected, but the popularity criterium is much harder to mine.

This project was done in co-operation with Zaharia, Andrei; Adekanle, Adoye and Chernichenko, Diana.
